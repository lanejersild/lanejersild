Hi my name is Lane Jersild and a am an analyst working with both data and business intelligence.

I worked 4 years as an analyst in college football.  During my time I worked primarily with excel and micrsoft office tools to create my visuals and presentations.  I have created 250+ data driven projects that I presented on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in front of the Head Coach and staff. 

I enrolled in the bootcamp to learn how to use other data visualization tools and ways to clean the data.  I want to transition out of working for college football programs and find a more stable and consistent position.

Feel free to contact me on my GitHub or LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/lane-jersild/
