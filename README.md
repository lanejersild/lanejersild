Hi my name is Lane Jersild and a am an analyst working with both data and business intelligence.

Currently I am enrolled in the tripleten business intelligence bootcamp.  During my time in the bootcamp I completed 7 techinical projects working with excel/sheets, SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI.  Before I enrolled in this I worked 4 years as an analyst in college football.  During my time I worked primarily with excel and micrsoft office tools to create my visuals and presentations.  I have created 250+ data driven projects that I presented on a weekly and sometimes daily basis in front of the Head Coach and staff. 

I enrolled in the bootcamp to learn how to use other data visualization tools and ways to clean the data.  I want to transition out of working for college football programs and find a more stable and consistent position.

Some fun facts about me:
-I love the mountains and love being outdoors
-I played college athletics
-I have lived in 20 states in my lifetime
-My goal is to have a dream position by January 2024!
